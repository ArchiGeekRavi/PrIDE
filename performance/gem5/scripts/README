# set the path to this gem5 repository
export GEM5_PATH=/home/scratch.ajaleel_nvresearch/rowhammer/gururaj/rowhammer_defense/aqua_gem5/gem5

# set the path to the SPEC 2017 repository
export SPEC17_PATH=/home/scratch.ajaleel_nvresearch/rowhammer/gururaj/rowhammer_defense/spec2017/spec-cpu-2017-main

# set the path to the checkpoints directory of SPEC 2017
export CKPT_PATH=/home/scratch.ajaleel_nvresearch/rowhammer/gururaj/rowhammer_defense/aqua_gem5/cpts

b) Launching simulations
